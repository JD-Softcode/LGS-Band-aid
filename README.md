# LGS-Band-aid
Dec 2018

Created to work around the issue with LGS v9.02.22 and macOS Majava 10.14.2 where LGS crashes every 20-30 minutes. Also, manually re-launching LGS made the "noisy" Logitech Updater flash many windows on the screen. This app monitors for both apps to keep LGS running and updater quiet.

Turns out the automatic relaunch of LGS does NOT trigger Updater to open so this symptom is better.
